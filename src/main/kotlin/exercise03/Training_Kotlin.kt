/**
 * Look under main/java/exercise03 and investigate Training_Java class.
 * As it can be seen, this class holds various information about training object.
 * In order to for instance print out this object, toString() method must be overwritten
 * and to guarantee readability of private variables, getters must be generated.
 *
 * In Kotlin, for such cases Data classes can be used.
 * Implement current empty class as Kotlin data class and compare how much the version in Kotlin and Java differ.
